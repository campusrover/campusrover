1. **Read**: Alex will lead a discussion about this paper: [Mataric - Behavior-Based Control: Main Properties and Implications](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Behavior-Based-Control-Main-Properties-and-Implica-Mataric/e977b4041c3bd3bab78a1775f052af227c390382). Everyone is asked to read the paper and follow links and add your comments in the margin of the paper: [Kami Link To Paper](https://goo.gl/ZtuZC2)
2. **Read Gen1 Documentation**: This material was carefully written by Gen1 out of an obligation to you, and a hope that their work would be built upon. Please read it closely and try and understand it so you can indeed use it. Remember **Gen3** will be reading your documentation that you will write with great care so you owe the generation before you the same care :)

#### Agenda for today

* How to think about the "plan for next week"
    * Please keep in mind the value of the research you are doing in completing your subproject and please keep notes in the spirit of a lab notebook so that the next generation benefit from your work. 
    * You should think of this plan as a "commitment" and it should be worded in that way. Of course even commitments may not be met due to unforseen problems. Certainly if there are "stretch" goals that is appropriate and are as stated "stretch", not a commitments
* Your "plan for next week" should:
    1. state What the high level objective and also include a little granular detail
    1. state who the students are working on it. If possible put names next to subtasks
    1. explain what will be demoed
    1. It should include any deliverables, including code, or "lab notebook" kind of info.
    1. This can be all bulletted and summarized, taking no more than 1/3 of a page.
  
#### Lab Demos

##### Demo: Ben + Alex Plam

* Our main demo goal for Wednesday is to be able to navigate around the large room outside the lab using only feducials.  We are also hoping to combine the fiducial logic with some LiDAR SLAM so the bot can avoid obstacles.

##### Demo: Ari + Jacky + Brad + Huaigu Plan

1. Get very simple SLAM working on TB2. (Ari, Jacky)
2. Get floor-plan into same file format as other SLAM maps (Brad, Huaigu)
3. Determine which areas of the map image need to be manually modified. (Brad, Huaigu)
4. Determine how to scale map. (Brad, Huaigu)
5. Test TB2 SLAM on area floor-plan-based map. (Everyone)
6.  Identify next steps. (Everyone)
7.  Deliverable: We will record and narrate a video of TB2 using SLAM to navigate Volen 1 using the floor-plan-based map.
