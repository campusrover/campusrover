1. **Read**: [Mataric - Behavior-Based Control: Main Properties and Implications](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Behavior-Based-Control-Main-Properties-and-Implica-Mataric/e977b4041c3bd3bab78a1775f052af227c390382)
1. **Read Gen1 Documentation**: This material was carefully written by Gen1 out of an obligation to you, and a hope that their work would be built upon. Please read it closely and try and understand it so you can indeed use it. Remember **Gen3** will be reading your documentation that you will write with great care so you owe the generation before you the same care :)
