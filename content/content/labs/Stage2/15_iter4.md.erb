  * [Real-time  3D  Traffic  Cone  Detection  for  Autonomous  DrivingAnkit Dhall, Dengxin Dai and Luc Van Gool](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02394)

#### Demo Script

* Robot is in a fairly open space with people around it
* Robot makes its "Yes?" sound
* Sibo says: "Robot mutant: this is Sibo"
* Robot spins around and finds Sibo and says "Hi Sibo, I see you"
* Sibo says: "Robot Mutant, Come here"
* Robot drives to Sibo, avoiding obstacles, and stops facing Sibo
* Sibo says: "Robot Mutant, I have a food order for you"
* Robot says: "Ok, place it in my basket"
* Sibo says: "Robot mutant, ok, please take it to Einsteins"
* Robot says: "On my way"
* Along the way, a person is in view of the Robot and is doing a waving gesture
* Robot stops and makes its "Yes?" sound
* Person says "Robot Mutant what are you doing?"
* Robot says "Sibo placed an order, I am taking it to Einsteins"
* Person says, "Robot Mutant, can I add something?"
* Robot says: "Sure, put the slip in my tray"
* Robot drives to "Einsteins" which is in a corner somewhere and stops
* Upon arriving, attendant takes the piece of paper, looks in the shelf, and places a bag of chips in the basket
* Attendant says: "Robot mutant, who is this for?"
* Robot says: "There are two orders, one for Sibo and one for Nate"
* Attendant says: "Robot mutant, Please deliver it now"
* Robot drives back. But in the meanwhile Sibo has moved
* Robot arrives where Sibo was and he is not there.
* Robot spins around and finds Sibo and drives to him and stops and makes his "Yes?" sound
* Sibo says: "Robot mutant, what do you have for me"
* Robot says: "As requested, I have a bag of chips. Bon Appetit!"
* Sibo says: "Robot mutant, Thanks, you can continue now"


#### Key behaviors
* Robot can make a "Yes?" sound, kind of an R2S2 chirp
* Robot can see someone waving and stops and makes the "Yes?" sound
* Robot can spin around to locate a given person visually
* Robot can navigate in space using a built in map
* Robot will avoid obstacles
* Robot keeps track what is in its tray, what the next destination is

#### Voice commands:

* All start with "Robot mutant"
    * "this is <name>" causes robot to spin around to find that person in space and confirm
    * "come here" causes robot to navigate in the direction of the last person they saw
    * "I have a question", just causes a chirp
    * "What are you doing", causes robot to say in English what its current state is
    * "Please deliver it now", assumes that robot has a knownn destination and goes there
    * "Please go there now", the same as deliver it now
    * "Can I add something", if robot beleives the tray has something in it, it answers `Yes`, otherwise it says `I have nothing in my tray right now, but go ahead`
    * "Thanks" can be placed anywhere and is ignored
    * "You can continue now" causes the robot to start going to its next destinatio, or to say "I am done with my chores"
