title: Guidelines to Charging Lipos
---
<%= list_begin %>

<%= le "Balance charge" %> Always balance charge multi-cell packs. If the voltage across the cells deviates too much (5 to 10mV) the battery can become unstable.
<%= le "Safety Bag" %> Always use a LiPo safety bag to charge and store LiPo batteries. While LiPo fires are rare, they can happen incredibly quickly and can do a lot of damage.
<%= le "Charging surface" %> When charging, chargers MUST BE on the charging surface
<%= le "Donâ€™t Overcharge" %> Never overcharge a LiPo
<%= le "Charging rate" %> Use the correct charging rate! Never charge at more than 2C charge rate
<%= le "Over discharge" %>Never discharge a LiPo below 3.0V (the TurtleBot3 automatically cuts off at XV
<%= le "Storage Voltage" %> Never leave LiPos at a full charge for more than 2-3 days.  Bring them to storage voltage (3.8V per cell) to preserve their longevity.
<%= le "Hot Battery is Bad" %> If a battery is ever warm from discharge or charge report it immediately (so we can check the internal resistance of the cells for damage before there is a disaster)
