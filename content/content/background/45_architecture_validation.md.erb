title: Architecture Validation

<%= callout("Caveat", " The whole point of this project is to learn more, so do not view this as a recipe or detailed roadmap. As you get into it you yourself will modify the goals and deliverables") %>


#### Introduction
We are embarked on defining a high level architecture for <%= link_to_section :intro, :campus_rover %>. This is a work in progress. We need to start building parts of it in skeleton form to validate and correct it. We are documenting the architecure in the [Campus Rover Architecture Wiki](https://github.com/campusrover/cosi119a-documentation/wiki).

#### Architectural goals
* Based on ROS
* Use as much ROS pre-existing nodes and code as possible
* Multi-level control
* Teleop override at all times
* Rely on live wifi connection at all times
* Expand the writeup of each node
* Must include at least topics subscribed and published
* Must include a narrative explaining how each node will work


#### Mission
* Implement the architecture in skeleton form to see if it can go together
* Validate, update and correct architecture writeup

#### Deliverable
* Demo code running in simulator
* Elaborated Architecture wiki or writeup
