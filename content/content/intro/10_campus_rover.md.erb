title: Campus Rover
---
#### Grand Vision

<blockquote class="pretty">Campus Rover will be able to deliver a small package between any two offices on the Brandeis campus, as long as there is an accessible route between the two offices. It will be able to navigate autonomously between the offices, down corridors, and between floors, going outdoors if needed.</blockquote>

#### Reality

This is a very difficult goal which we will not reach in the first, second or third semester of this course. Some of the very difficult parts of this are:

* Building a complete map of the campus that includes all the offices, obstacles and so on.
* Dealing with non-fixed obstacles, like, people
* Navigating outdoors, where there are no barriers to guide navigation
* Navigating outdoors, where distance measuring sensors (like lasers, ultrasonic or IR) all have a hard time due to sunlight
* Going up and down between floors - using elevators?

And those are just the ones we can think of so far. Most likely those are the easy difficult parts.

### CampusRover Mark2: What will it be? Options are:
* Build a new platform that is capable of all interior surfaces
* Extend functionality in a linear sense
* A whole new BHAG

### CampusRover Mark1: "Package delivery robot for first floor of Volen only."

#### CampusRover Mark 1: Initial Requirements

* Able to move effectively on all interior surfaces of Volen's first floor.
* A tablet or other screen mounted on top provides a UI
* Built in map of the floor and the offices
* Uses Fiducials to orient itself
* Has knowledge of the room numbers of all rooms on Volen's first floor
* Commands issued on the tablet to navigate to the designated room
* Built on the Turtlebot2
* Some kind of enclosure to make it look cool
